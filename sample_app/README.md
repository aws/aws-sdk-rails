## ActiveSupport Notifications

ActiveSupport notifications for AWS clients are configured in
`config/initializers/instrument_aws_sdk/rb` to log an event
whenever an AWS client makes any service calls.  To demo, follow
any one of the ActiveStorage, SES or SQS ActiveJob and the
AWS calls should be logged with:
`Recieved an ActiveSupport::Notification for: send_message.SQS.aws event`

## SQS ActiveJob

* Start rails with `AWS_ACTIVE_JOB_QUEUE_URL=https://my_sqs_queue_url rails server`
* Visit/curl `http://127.0.0.1:3000/test-job?name=my_name` - This will queue a job up
* Poll for and process jobs with: `AWS_ACTIVE_JOB_QUEUE_URL=https://my_sqs_queue_url bundle exec aws_sqs_active_job --queue default`

## AWS Record Generators
