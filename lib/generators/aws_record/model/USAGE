Description:
    Rails generator for aws-record models.

    Pass the name of the model (preferably in singular form), and an optional list of attributes.

    Attributes are declarations of the fields that you wish to store within a model. You can pass
    a type and list of options for each attribute in the form: `name:type:options`. If you do not provide
    a type, it is assumed that the attribute is of type `string_attr`.

    Each model should have an hkey, if one is not present a `uuid:hkey` will be created for you.

    Timestamps are not added by default but you can add them using the `--timestamps` flag.
    
    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

    More information can be found at: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-rails?tab=readme-ov-file#aws-record-model-generators

Example:
    rails generate aws_record:model Forum forum_uuid:hkey post_id:rkey post_title post_body tags:sset:default_value{Set.new} created_at:datetime:d_attr_name{PostCreatedAtTime} moderation:boolean:default_value{false}

    This will create:
        app/models/forum.rb
        db/table_config/forum_config.rb
